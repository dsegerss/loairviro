Description
﻿SpecialCells is an add-on for the Calc spreadsheet component of OpenOffice.org and StarOffice.
It provides two dialogues for selecting and navigating ranges of a single sheet.
Dialogue "Cell Contents" distinguishes cells by their contents and visibility.
Dialogue "Format Ranges" distinguishes groups of equally formatted cells.
The inspected range and the found ranges can be navigated by list boxes and scroll bars.
The inspected sheets won't be changed in any way. The package
comes with a Writer document as help-file and a localizable set-up.
For details on localization read Localization.sxw in the distributed package.
